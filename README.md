# Signal-Processing-Course-Projects
This repository contains the projects of the Signal Processing course at the University of Tehran.<br>
Details of each Assignment can be seen in its Report file.

Each Assignments consists of different parts:

## CA1
* Introduction to MATLAB and its basic tools.
* Linear Regression in MATLAB
* Find the distance of a vehicle using the reflection of a sound wave and Inner product as a correlation tool.
* Changing the speed of a sound.

## CA2
* Persian OCR using MATLAB
* Car Plate Recognition using MATLAB
* Combining these two features to read the car's Persian plate numbers from an image.

## CA3
* Encoding a Message into an Image.
* Decoding the same message from the image.
* Using Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) to make the sound of a phone number.
* Decoding the phone number from the sound using DTMF.
* Use correlation to detect specific ICs on a board.

## CA4
* Encoding a message into a wave by changing its amplitude.
* Decoding the same message from the wave using correlation.
* Find the distance of a vehicle using the reflection of a sound wave and Convolution as a correlation tool.
* Make a number reader program by combining sounds.

## CA5
* Introduction to fast Fourier transform (FFT) in MATLAB.
* Encoding a message into a wave by changing its frequency.
* Decoding the same message from the wave using FFT.

## CA6
* Find the distance of a vehicle using doppler effect and FFT.
* Generate a song with given notes.
* Find the notes of a song using FFT.

## CA7
